## ✅ OVERALL VERDICT

🟢 **Your structure is 90–95% PERFECT**
🟢 **Absolutely acceptable for production & interviews**
🟡 Only **minor refinements**, not redesign
❌ Nothing major to remove

So don’t worry — you are already in a **very good state**.

I’m referring to the structure you shared .

---

## ✅ WHAT IS 100% CORRECT (DO NOT CHANGE)

These modules are **exactly right** and should stay as-is:

### ✔ `auth`

* User entity in `auth.entity` ✅
* UserRepository in `auth.repository` ✅
* AuthController / AuthService separation ✅

This matches:

> “Auth service owns identity”

---

### ✔ `job`

* Job entity
* JobSkill join entity
* DTO separation
* Repository placement

✔ Matches MWB
✔ Microservice-ready

---

### ✔ `application`

* Application entity
* Status enum usage
* Clean controller/service split

✔ Correct
✔ No change needed

---

### ✔ `organization`

* Organization entity mapped to `companies`
* Clean ownership

✔ Correct naming
✔ Correct responsibility

---

### ✔ `audit`

* AuditLog entity
* Separate repository & service

✔ Industry standard
✔ Good for admin & compliance

---

### ✔ `admin` and `report`

* Admin has **no entities** (read-only) ✅
* A separate report module ✅

✔ This is how real systems do it

---

## 🟡 SMALL IMPROVEMENTS (RECOMMENDED, NOT MANDATORY)

These are **refinements**, not errors.

---

### 🔧 1. `ProfileRepository` naming (IMPORTANT)

Current:

```text
profile/repository/ProfileRepository.java
```

🟡 Issue:

* You actually have **multiple profile entities**:

  * JobSeekerProfile
  * RecruiterProfile
  * JobSeekerSkill

### ✅ Recommended fix

Split repositories:

```text
profile/repository/
├── JobSeekerProfileRepository.java
├── RecruiterProfileRepository.java
└── JobSeekerSkillRepository.java
```

**Why**

* Clear responsibility
* Cleaner queries
* Easier microservice split later

---

### 🔧 2. `Role` duplication (IMPORTANT)

You currently have:

```text
common/enums/Role.java
common/entity/Role.java
```

🟡 This is **confusing**.

### ✅ Choose ONE approach (recommended)

**Option A (BEST for now)**
✔ Keep enum
❌ Remove entity

```diff
- common/entity/Role.java
```

Use:

```java
enum Role { ADMIN, RECRUITER, JOB_SEEKER }
```

Map `role_id` manually (as you already do).

👉 Simpler, fewer joins.

---

### 🔧 3. `Skill` location (MINOR)

Currently:

```text
common/entity/Skill.java
```

🟡 This is acceptable
🟢 Also acceptable alternative:

```text
job/entity/Skill.java
```

But since **skills are shared** between:

* jobs
* job seekers

👉 **Keeping Skill in `common.entity` is OK**
No change required unless you want stricter domain boundaries.

---

### 🔧 4. `JobSkill` composite key (CHECK)

You have:

```text
job/entity/JobSkill.java
```

✔ Correct

Just ensure:

* Composite key (`job_id`, `skill_id`)
* Or surrogate `id`

This is a **code-level check**, not structure change.

---

## ❌ WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT ADD / REMOVE

### ❌ Do NOT add entities for:

* `v_job_summary`
* `v_job_skills`
* `v_applications_by_seeker`

Correctly missing — good job 👍

---

### ❌ Do NOT merge modules

* Keep `profile` separate from `auth`
* Keep `organization` separate from `profile`

You already did this correctly.

---

## 📌 FINAL RECOMMENDED CHANGES SUMMARY

### ✅ Must-do (small)

1. Split `ProfileRepository` into 2–3 repositories
2. Remove **either** `Role enum` or `Role entity` (keep enum)

### 🟢 Optional (nice-to-have)

* Double-check `JobSkill` composite key

### ❌ No removals required

Everything else stays.
